# Smash-OUT!
Inspired by the famous arcade game 'Breakout' by Atari Inc., Smash Out is built using a step-by-step tutorial on '2D breakout game using Phaser' available on Mozilla.
Using a single ball, you must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If your paddle misses the ball's rebound, you will lose a turn. You have three turns to try to clear the bricks. Use your mouse to control the paddle movement.
